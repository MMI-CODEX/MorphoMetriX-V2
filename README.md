Let MorphoMetriX streamline the often tedious process of making photogrammetric measurements for you, offering a quick intuitive GUI to calculate piecewise/arc lengths and width profiles along segments/curves and areas for polygons. 
    
Also check out [CollatriX](https://github.com/cbirdferrer/collatrix)<sup>1</sup>, a GUI to collate multiple MorphoMetriX outputs into a single datafile with add-on functions for correcting altitude error from UAS (drone) flights and calculating animal body condition.
